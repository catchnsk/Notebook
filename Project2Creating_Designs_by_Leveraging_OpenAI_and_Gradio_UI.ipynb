        "This project demonstrates the development of an AI-powered design generation platform that combines OpenAI's DALL·E image generation capabilities with Gradio's intuitive web interface. Built for a creative agency context, this tool enables rapid conceptualization and prototyping of marketing campaign visuals through natural language descriptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Project Context:** As a designer at a creative agency, I developed this web-based platform to streamline the ideation process for Netflix-style marketing campaign concepts. The tool allows marketing teams and designers to generate banner and poster designs using text prompts, significantly reducing the time from concept to visual mockup.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Technologies:**\n",
        "- **OpenAI DALL·E 3** - State-of-the-art text-to-image generation\n",
        "- **Gradio** - Python framework for building ML web interfaces\n",
